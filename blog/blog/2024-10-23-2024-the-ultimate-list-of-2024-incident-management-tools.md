## Introduction

Incident management tools are important for organizations to effectively handle service outages.
With so many incident management tools around with different feature sets, it's often difficult to find the one that is right for your needs.
In this article, we attempt to make a list of incident management software available in 2024 with their features to help you arrive at the right one.

We have focused mostly on tools that offer incident management capabilities - which include at least incident lifecycle management, on-call scheduling, and third-party integrations. 

There are many good tools which are focused only on incident response, or on monitoring and generating alerts, or on the ticketing aspect of incidents.
 We have not included those to avoid cluttering this article.

## Benefits of Using an Incident Management Tool
- An incident management tool streamlines the incident management process by helping to define and automate workflows. It can help you create runbooks, alerting and escalation policies, and define and manage on-call schedules.
- Incident Management software often come with integrations with your observability stack. Your observability stack is a key source of incidents. They can also integrate with your existing [communication](/The-Rising-Role-of-Slack-in-Incident-Management) and <!-- truncate -->collaboration tools to provide real-time updates.
- Some incident management tools add context to your incident analysis by pulling in data from your infrastructure, applications, and observability systems. 
This can help in narrowing down the root cause.
- Incident management tools can provide analytics which can be used to gain insights into patterns and performance to create a culture of continuous improvement.
- An incident management tool can also provide audit trails and standardized documentation for compliance requirements.
- Some tools have public and private [status pages](/Best-Practices-Choosing-Status-Page-Provider) so that stakeholders can get more visibility into the process.

## Conclusion

Choosing an incident management tool involves looking at many aspects including:
- Features - Instead of looking at the number of features, list down the ones you actually need for your team and evaluate based on that.
- Cost - Incident Management is a key part of your business operations, so you also need to forecast future costs if your team or infrastructure is growing.
- Customer support - Your incident management systems' reliability needs to be top-notch. However, incidents happen, even in incident management software, so make sure they have great customer support.
- Integration capabilities - Your team might be using [multiple observability tools](/The-Benefits-of-a-Single-Incident-Management-System), either third-party or custom or both. Any incident management tool should be able to integrate well with your existing stack as well as with your communication and collaboration tools.
- Reports - Metrics and analytics are invaluable for figuring out trends in your outages and where to focus on for improvement.
- Flexibility in scheduling - Easy roster setup and overrides are a must.
- Alignment with your regulatory requirements, if any.
- Documentation/knowledge base integration.

Choose the tool that is right for you and your team - which may not necessarily be the one that everybody else is using because it's the "best".
